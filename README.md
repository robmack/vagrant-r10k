vagrant-r10k is a [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) 1.2+ middleware plugin to allow you to have just a Puppetfile and
manifests in your vagrant project, and pull in the required modules via [r10k](https://github.com/adrienthebo/r10k). This
plugin only works with the 'puppet' provisioner, not a puppet server. It expects you to have a Puppetfile in the same repository
as your Vagrantfile.

## Installation

    $ vagrant plugin install vagrant-r10k

__Note__ that if you include modules from a (the) forge in your Puppetfile, i.e. in the format

    mod 'username/modulename'

instead of just git references, you will need the ``puppet`` rubygem installed and available. It
is not included in the Gemfile so that users who only use git references won't have a new/possibly
conflicting Puppet installation.

## Usage

Add the following to your Vagrantfile, before the puppet section:

    config.r10k.puppet_dir = 'dir' # the parent directory that contains your module directory and Puppetfile
    config.r10k.puppetfile_path = 'dir/Puppetfile' # the path to your Puppetfile, within the repo

For the following example directory structure:

    .
    ├── README.md
    ├── Vagrantfile
    ├── docs
    │   └── foo.md
    ├── puppet
    │   ├── Puppetfile
    │   ├── manifests
    │   │   └── default.pp
    │   └── modules
    └── someproject
        └── foo.something

The configuration for r10k and puppet would look like:

    # r10k plugin to deploy puppet modules
    config.r10k.puppet_dir = "puppet"
    config.r10k.puppetfile_path = "puppet/Puppetfile"
    
    # Provision the machine with the appliction
    config.vm.provision "puppet" do |puppet|
      puppet.manifests_path = "puppet/manifests"
      puppet.manifest_file  = "default.pp"
      puppet.module_path = "puppet/modules"
    end

If you provide an array of directories in puppet.module_path, vagrant-r10k will use the first directory listed for auto configuration. If you want to let r10k use a different directory, see below.

### Usage with explicit path to module installation directory

Add the following to your Vagrantfile, before the puppet section:

    config.r10k.puppet_dir = 'dir' # the parent directory that contains your module directory and Puppetfile
    config.r10k.puppetfile_path = 'dir/Puppetfile' # the path to your Puppetfile, within the repo
    config.r10k.module_path = 'dir/moduledir' # the path where r10k should install its modules (should be same / one of those in puppet provisioner, will be checked)

For the following example directory structure:

    .
    ├── README.md
    ├── Vagrantfile
    ├── docs
    │   └── foo.md
    ├── puppet
    │   ├── Puppetfile
    │   ├── manifests
    │   │   └── default.pp
    │   ├── modules # your own modules
    │   └── vendor # modules installed by r10k
    └── someproject
	└── foo.something

The configuration for r10k and puppet would look like:

    # r10k plugin to deploy puppet modules
    config.r10k.puppet_dir = "puppet"
    config.r10k.puppetfile_path = "puppet/Puppetfile"
    config.r10k.module_path = "puppet/vendor"
    
    # Provision the machine with the appliction
    config.vm.provision "puppet" do |puppet|
      puppet.manifests_path = "puppet/manifests"
      puppet.manifest_file  = "default.pp"
      puppet.module_path = ["puppet/modules", "puppet/vendor"]
    end

## Getting Help

Bug reports, feature requests, and pull requests are always welcome. At this time, the
[GitHub Issues Tracker](https://github.com/jantman/vagrant-r10k/issues)
is the only place for support, so questions and comments are welcome there as well,
but please be sure they haven't already been asked and answered.

Bug reports should include the following information in order to be investigated:

1. A detailed description of the problem, including the behavior you expected and
   the actual behavior that you're observing.
2. The output of ``vagrant plugin list`` showing all of the plugins you're running
   and their versions.
3. The versions of Ruby (``ruby --version``) and Vagrant (``vagrant --version``)
   itself that you're running.
4. A copy of the Vagrantfile that was being used. Please include all lines in it;
   if you have any confidential or proprietary information, feel free to replace
   usernames, passwords, URLs, IPs, etc. with "X"s, but please don't remove
   large portions of it.
5. A debug-level log of the command you're having problems with. i.e. if your
   problem is experienced when running ``vagrant up``, please include the full
   output of ``VAGRANT_LOG=debug vagrant up``.

## Development

__Note__ that developming vagrant plugins _requires_ ruby 2.0.0 or newer.
A `.ruby-version` is provided to get [rvm](https://rvm.io/workflow/projects)
to use 2.1.1.

### Unit Tests

These will be automatically run by TravisCI for any pull requests or commits
to the repository. To run manually:

    bundle install --path vendor
    bundle exec rake spec

### Acceptance Tests

Unfortunately, "acceptance" testing Vagrant requires the various providers
be functional; i.e. to test the [VMWare Providers](https://www.vagrantup.com/vmware)
requires both a license for them from Hashicorp, and the VMWare products
themselves. Similarly, testing the AWS providers requires an AWS account and
actually running EC2 instances. As such, acceptance tests are provided separately
for each provider.

Note that the acceptance tests are tested with bundler 1.7.14. Also note that
the first time the VMWare provider is run in a given installation, it will
present an interactive sudo prompt in order to be able to interact with
VMWare.

Running Virtualbox acceptance tests:

    bundle exec rake acceptance:virtualbox

When tests fail, they leave Virtualbox ``hostonlyif``s around; this can quickly clutter up the
system and cause other problems. As a result, after the virtualbox tests, we invoke the Vagrant
VirtualBox Provider's [delete_unused_host_only_networks](https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/blob/b118ab10c8e0f8e62a547249805f05240e6e4ee9/plugins/providers/virtualbox/driver/version_5_0.rb#L69)
method. This can also be manually run via ``bundle exec rake clean_vbox``.

These tests may generate a _lot_ of output; since there's no nice standalone junit XML viewer,
it may be helpful to run the tests as:

    bundle exec rake acceptance:virtualbox 2>&1 | tee acceptance.out

And then examine ``acceptance.out`` as needed.


__Note__ that the vmware-workstation provider acceptance tests are not currently
functional; I've only been able to get the VirtualBox acceptance tests working.
If many users report vmware-specific problems, I'll give the tests another try.
Helpful information for them is available at http://www.codingonstilts.com/2013/07/how-to-bundle-exec-vagrant-up-with.html
and https://groups.google.com/d/topic/vagrant-up/J8J6LmhzBqM/discussion
I had these working at some point, but have been unable to get them working since;
it seems that (a bit painfully and ironically), mitchellh's [vagrant-spec](https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant-spec/)
doesn't seem to work cleanly with Hashicorp's paid/licensed Vagrant providers.

Running (currently broken) VMWare Workstation acceptance tests:

    bundle exec rake acceptance:vmware_workstation

### Manually Testing Vagrant

For manual testing:

    bundle install --path vendor
	VAGRANT_LOG=debug bundle exec vagrant up

To use an existing project's Vagrantfile, you can just specify the directory that the Vagrantfile
is in using the ``VAGRANT_CWD`` environment variable (i.e. prepend ``VAGRANT_CWD=/path/to/project``
to the above command).

Note that this will not work easily with the VMWare provider, or any other Hashicorp paid/licensed provider.

### Debugging

Exporting ``VAGRANT_LOG=debug`` will also turn on debug-level logging for r10k.

### Releasing

1. Ensure all tests are passing, coverage is acceptable, etc.
2. Increment the version number in ``lib/vagrant-r10k/version.rb``
3. Update CHANGES.md
4. Push those changes to origin.
5. ``bundle exec rake build``
6. ``bundle exec rake release``
